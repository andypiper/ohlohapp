Ohloh apps
==========

I really like Ohloh, which is a super cool site for analysing source code.

They have an API, too. How busy have you been? How has a source base changed over time? You can track that stuff.

So I'm noodling around with their API, and also trying to fix up some of the sample apps they posted on their own site (since they don't appear to have a Github repo with their own code).

LICENSE
=======

Since most of these samples are from Ohloh's site and don't include a license, I'm not sure. Sorry.
